  <h2>GNU/Linux, now !</h2>
  <ol>
  <li>Insert the CD</li>
  <li>Boot up your PC</li>
  <li>Wait a few seconds (well, a few minutes)</li>
  <li>Select a speech synthesizer</li>
  <li>That's all, GNU/Linux is yours!</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Objectives</h2>
  <h3>Ease the access to GNU/Linux</h3>
  <p>Oralux hopes to facilitate access to GNU/Linux for the visually
  impaired.</p>
  <p>Firstly, through  lowering the barrier by facilitating installation  of the necessary software.</p>
  <p>At the moment, the current version  offers  an experienced user a quick way to
  have GNU/Linux working on a PC.</p>
  <p>The Oralux project must go further.</p>
  <p>We hope to <em>help and guide the newbie</em>   to reach the following initial stages:</p>
  <ul>
  <li>starting with Emacspeak or Yasr</li>
  <li>finding relevant documentation and browsing it,</li>
  <li>receiving and sending emails,</li>
  <li>browsing the web,</li>
  <li>and whatever else might be important to you...</li>
  </ul>
  <p>You may want to help us to reach these aims by sharing your skills:
  advising and giving feedback, supplying configuration files, translating documentation, writing a
  tutorial and developing the Oralux scripts (shell and php).</p>

  <h3>Also</h3>
  <p>We hope to integrate other environments, e.g. Speakup and Gnopernicus.</p>
  <p>We would like to offer multi-language, free speech synthesis on the CD, so that the user may start with his/her native language.</p>

  <h2>A few features</h2>
  <h3>About the CD</h3>
  <p>Oralux is a <a href="http://www.knopper.net/knoppix/index-en.html">Knoppix</a>
  customization, the self-installing distro created by Klaus Knopper. Knoppix includes, on a single CD, nearly three
  compressed CDs.</p>
  <p>Oralux boots up from the CD, whatever the already installed operating system (Win98, XP,...) may be.</p>
  <p>Oralux includes, thanks to <a href="http://www.mielke.cc/brltty/">BRLTTY</a>, a number of <a href="faq.php#braillepossible">braille drivers</a>.</p>
  
  <h3>The audio environment</h3>
  <p>The Oralux user interface is based on <a href="http://emacspeak.sourceforge.net/">Emacspeak</a> the Audio
    Desktop created by T. V. Raman. Emacspeak offers a complete and
    powerful desktop.</p>
  <p>Another environment is available based on <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/yasr/">Yasr</a>, the lightweight and portable screen reader by Mike Gorse.</p>
  <p>The CD includes a free English Text-To-Speech software (TTS): <a href="http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/">Flite</a>
  (Carnegie Mellon University).</p>
  <p>It also includes <a href="http://www.pollock-nageoire.net/festival/">EFM</a> from <span lang="fr">Pierre Lorenzon</span> for French and English. EFM is based on <a href="http://www.cstr.ed.ac.uk/projects/festival/">Festival</a> (University of Edinburgh) and <a href="http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola.html">MBROLA</a> (<span lang="fr">Thierry Dutoit, Universite de Mons</span>).</p>
  <p>Using Festival and MBROLA, implementing other languages might be possible: contributors are welcome!</p>

  <p>ParleMax is a speech server in French based on LLiaphon and MBROLA. ParleMax and LLiaphon come from 
  the <a href="http://www.culte.org/projets/biglux/">Biglux</a> team.</p>

  <p>Multispeech is a speech server based for Russian on Ru_tts and for the English on freephone and MBROLA. Multispeech can automatically switch from one synthesis to the other. Igor B. Poretsky is the <a href="ftp://ftp.rakurs.spb.ru/pub/Goga">Multispeech and Ru_tts</a> author.</p>  

  <p>Oralux can install the DECtalk software synthesizer (4.61 or 5.0), a multi language TTS
  from the Fonix company. This TTS allows Oralux to access the following languages: English or Castillan Spanish, French or German.</p>
