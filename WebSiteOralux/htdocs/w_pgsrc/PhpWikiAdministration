! ZIP files of database

 __[ZIP Snapshot | phpwiki:?zip=snapshot]__ : contains only the latest versions

 __[ZIP Dump | phpwiki:?zip=all]__ : contains all archived versions

These links lead to zip files, generated on the fly, which contain the most
recent versions of all pages in the PhpWiki. The pages are stored, one per
file, as MIME (RFC2045) e-mail (RFC822) messages, with the content type
application/x-phpwiki for the snapshot and content type multipart/mixed for
the dump. In the latter case, there is one subpart (with type
application/x-phpwiki) for each version of the
page (in chronological order). The message body contains the page text,
while the page meta-data is included as parameters in the
Content-Type: header field.

! Load / Dump Serialized Pages

Here you can load or dump pages of your Wiki into a directory of your
choice.

__Dump__

%%ADMIN-INPUT-dumpserial-Dump_serialized_pages%%

Pages will be written out as "serialized" strings of a PHP
associative array, meaning they will not be human readable. If
the directory does not exist PhpWiki will try to create one for you.
Ensure that your server has write permissions to the directory!

__Load__

%%ADMIN-INPUT-loadserial-Load_serialized_pages%%

If you have dumped a set of pages from PhpWiki, you can reload them here.
Note that pages in your database will be overwritten; thus, if you dumped
your FrontPage when you load it from this form it will overwrite the one
in your database now. If you want to be selective just delete
the pages from the directory you don't want to load.
