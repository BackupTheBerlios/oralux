PhpWiki is written in the server-side scripting language PHP, available from http://www.php.net/. PHP resembles C and Perl in its syntax, and functions much like ASP, EmbPerl or JSP.

PhpWiki consists of a dozen or so files of mixed PHP and HTML. The web pages that make up a WikiWikiWeb based on PHP live in a DBM file with backup copies of previous versions of pages stored in a second DBM file.

Every time a user hits the site the page requested is pulled from the DBM and rendered on the fly. The user only ever requests the file w_index.php, which then decides which other php files to include.

Links to pages in the wiki are automatically linked: PhpWiki. This might be the single most compelling aspect of a wiki, the ability to add pages simply by linking to them. The next most compelling thing is how easily external URL's link:
# http://www.wcsb.org/
# ftp://ftp.redhat.com/
# news://news.mozilla.org/

Combined with one namespace and a simple markup, a Wiki exhibits many of the characteristics of WabiSabi.

PhpWiki is licensed under the Gnu General Public license, which you should be able to see here: http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.txt.
