1. Accessibility statement
The Oralux site hopes to be accessible.
For any further update, we'll try to keep in mind the accessibility
approach: removing the technical barriers so that anyone may get the public
information on the site. Even if our visitor doesn't rely e.g. on a
screen, or a mouse.

A nice layout may be appreciated by some of our users, but the layout is just
a mean not the aim. We are aware that this layout may build a very high barrier for some users. 

Any of the Oralux web pages are tested according our accessibility statement.
Please, read the file htm/accessibility.htm ,about the
expected checks.

2. Structure
2.1 Skeleton
We rely on php to ease managing the web pages.
The skeleton of a page is known by the class webpage (file
webpage.php).
This will automatically builds the html structure (doctype, head, body,
header, navigation bars and footer).

To add a new page, just copy and rename skeleton.php.
You will find more details inside this file.

2.2 Directories
2.2.1 website
This is the "document directory": the directory which is reached when
http://oralux.org is called.

So, index.php is the home page, and you will find too (May 2003), faq.php, download.php.
The website directory includes the php files which were copied from the skeleton.php file.

2.2.2 website/htm
These are the shrunks of html code, the content of the web page. They
do not include the doctype, navbars,... which are automatically added
by the php file.

2.2.3 website/icons
These are the icons of the site: images and sounds.

2.2.4 website/styles
This directory contains the styles sheets.

2.3 Internationalization (i18n)
As we hope that the Oralux will be shared and improved through the
web, the original language is english.
If possible, we want to supply the web page in the visitors' native
language. 

3. PhpWiki
The directories prefixed by w_ come from PhpWiki (release 1.2.2).
A few files have been modified; we hope that the first added comments clearly identify our changes.
