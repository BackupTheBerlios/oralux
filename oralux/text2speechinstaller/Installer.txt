1. Introduction
---------------

A typical user is a low sighted or blind person using e.g. the Windows
OS with a screen reader. This is just an example. In fact, this is someone who
would like to use emacspeak but who has no particular skill to install
Linux, and all the concerned softwares.

The following lines describe how Oralux will install the DECtalk software through the Fonix installer.

2 First use
-----------
The user ownes e.g. a PC such as: OS is Windows; a hard disk with a FAT partition 

a. The person buys online thanks to her screen reader the DECtalk software (today named linux_runtime_4.61_intel.tar.gz).

b. She stores it on her hard disk under directory C:/dtk
   (C: is a FAT partition).

   Finally, we have :

   C:/dtk/linux_runtime_4.61_intel.tar.gz

c. She inserts the Oralux CD and reboots her PC.

d. The PC boots on the CD which starts the Oralux installer.

e. It checks if the usual DECtalk files (libtts.so,...) are present on her hard disk (under C:/dtk).

d. Since there is only the linux_runtime tar.gz under C:/dtk, the Oralux installer follows this sequence:

- 'Untars' the linux runtime (linux_runtime_4.61_intel.tar.gz)
- Updates the BASE_DIR variable in files.sh
  so that the DECtalk files are installed in the wished directory.
  e.g.:
  BASE_DIR="/ramdisk/user/local"
- Plays a wav file (detailled in paragraph e.)
- Starts the Fonix installer which prints "Please enter your serial number".

e. The user hears: 

   "Please enter your serial number".

   (The talked sentence may come from an audio file (wav,...) included
   in the Oralux CD).

   and types the serial number which is checked by the Fonix installer
 
f. The FONIX installer installs its distinct files. 
   With a usual Linux distribution, the Fonix installer copies the files to the hard disk.
g. Finally, the Oralux installer copies the files from the RAM to C:/dtk 
   Because of the bootable distribution, the usual tree is in RAM.
   E.g. DECtalk.conf is in RAM and libtts.so is in RAM too.
   So that the DECtalk files aren't lost when the PC is turned off, the files are copied from RAM to the hard drive. 

h. The user may enjoy the DECtalk software.

3. Following uses
-----------------
For the following boots up, the sequence is lighter:

a. The PC boots on the CD which starts the Oralux installer.

b. It checks if the usual DECtalk files (libtts.so,...) are present on her hard disk (under C:/dtk).

c. Since there are present, the Oralux installer copies the distinct files from C:/dtk to RAM (e.g. to /ramdisk/user/local, /etc)

d. The user still may enjoy the DECtalk software.
