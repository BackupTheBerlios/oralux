I Introduction

I Introduction
I.1 Free TTS
In the Oralux CDrom is embedded a free TTS software. In the first Oralux release, flite is driven by eflite so that Oralux may speak english.
Many thanks to their contributors. 
Hoping that in the future, the french language will be provided too :)

I.2 Commercial TTS
I contacted a few companies selling multi languages TTS, especially english and french languages.
This is not for profit, we do not receive any money for that! 
We just need to work with french texts. 

With this approach, Oralux let people choose: either free or commercial TTS or both!

The DECtalk software from Fonix was already compliant with emacspeak. 
This is the only company that I found, able to sell a multi language and low cost run time package for Linux.
So, thanks to the Fonix team.
 
Besides it, if you know other synthesis, well you are welcome to inform us!

I.3 Installing a commercial TTS
So, Oralux is now able to install the DECtalk software package that you bought from the Fonix website www.fonix.com and that you stored on your hard disk.
If you stored DECtalk on a partition which is not a NTFS partition, your serial number will be asked just once. 
Because we are able to copy the files uncompressed by the Fonix installer on your partition for the future uses.
If DECtalk is stored on a NTFS partition, well as we do not know yet writing on it, the serial number will be asked each time you boot on the CD.
