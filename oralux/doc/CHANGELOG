mcvox is a Midnight Commander derivative which aims to supply a simple
user interface for rendering by a voice synthesis or via tiny displays.
We have started mcvox to enhance the previous minimenu in 0.6 alpha. 

Using mcvox, several formats are automatically converted to text files. The formats are MS-Excel (XLS), MS-Word, PDF, Open Office (SXW or SXI), Postcript, Power Point, RTF.


Notice in /etc/profile:
EDITOR=ne, PAGER=w3m

* Reinitialize the speech server (using Control Alt i).
Helpful if the speech server hangs or crashs. Reinitialization is
available in standard or review mode.

Release "From Libre Software Meeting 2004"
Date: 7 July 2004

* Overview:
the sticky keys and repeat keys can be selected from the audio menu, more doc in Spanish or Russian, a few bugs have been fixed, .  

* Minor updates:

This release is still based on Knoppix 3.3 (2004-02-16).

* Doc
- intro-ru.txt has been translated in Russian by Sergei V. Fleytin. 
- Emacs and calendar tutorials in Spanish: Miguel Paolino has translated the tutorials written by Sylvie in Spanish. 
He also translated the remaining sentences of the FAQ.

* Bug fixes
* Spell checker
/ Emacs uses aspell instead of ispell.
/ LANGUAGE = 'en' instead of 'us'. 

- DECtalk 5.0 speech server is much more usable, the dtk-soft changes were forgotten in the previous release. Tim Cross posts to the Emacspeak mailing list have been taken in account. 
- Entering the serial number for DECtalk: the keyboard must be updated according to the last choice.
- Shutdown: the PC is correctly turned off. 
- cdtool: cdstart didn't work (wrong link)
- Starting Yasr: only a shell, no menu! (Observed with DECtalk English or ParleMax). 
- floppy: at init time, we do not check anymore if the configuration is saved on the floppy disk. Because when no floppy drive is present, it slows down a lot the initialization. To force the check, type at boot: 
knoppix floppyconf 
or 
knoppix floppyconfig

Note that by default we will select /dev/fd0. 

* Enhancements

- BRLTTY is not started by default (the "no speech support" message is misleading). 
- dialog: text based output instead of the usual graphical layout (tested with pppconfig and knoppix-installer). 

** Menu
- yasr: when a new speech server is selected, the yasr conf is reinstalled. However, the other user's modifications (keybindings) must not be lost. 
- Sticky keys: turned on or off. 
- Repeat keys: turned on or off. 

** Russian support:
- Russian translations: still a few messages for the menu. 
- aspell ru.
