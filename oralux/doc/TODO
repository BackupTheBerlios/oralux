This document lists the known bugs (-) and the next hoped features (+) in four categories:
1. Runtime
2. SDK (Software development kit) 
3. Website
4. Info
5. Suggestions

The so called SDK is a set of tools useful to build or rebuild the Oralux CD. 
Besides it, the runtime manages the following stages:
- Initializing the user account
- Asking to the user about her preferences (TTS, language,..)
- Starting Emacspeak

The Info paragraph is useful to remember the informations to collect for the next developments.

Conventions:

+ Evolution
- Bug
/ Done 
X Checked

1. Runtime
In the following lines, + means evolution, - bug.

1.1 Priority 1 (Urgent)


+ Configuration files in the boot floppy: 
The very basic configuration files can now be saved in the boot floppy.
 


+ doc update: http://fsfeurope.org/projects/education/tgs/tagatschool7.fr.html
+ check if persistenthome still works

+ see fix http://www.knoppix.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=12960&highlight=
+ update main.c DESKTOP = shell, the oralux.sh proposes then to start zsh.
main.c must indicate that CTRL-D will be rquired to come back to the menu (ther e must be a more direct way in the future).
+ zsh and "sudo su"

+ oralux.sh c can start zsh (DESKTOP)
+ minimenu proposes zsh instead of bash
+ HardDiskInstall: do not ask any more to take the CD

+ edbrowse (0.6 beta or 0.6)

+ A persistent /var 
/ mail about RealPlayer and Helix to the Helix forum. 
+ Helix forum: asks about the SDK, see test suite.

Debian Ada packages (-gtk +cryptography support as well
as many of the libraries including the text one).

+ ".mailcap and .mime.types.  These files were in the user's
home directory, and assisted with the connection between such browsers
as w3 and w3m and the trplayer program and any other "viewers" for
file types that the user might want.  Their contents were rather
cryptic so I never messed mutch with them, but you could add to them
to make other programs work.  This little package, which, at the time
I had it, came in a tarball, made it possible to just click on
something and it would play.  You will need to track this down as well
before adding trplayer/realplayer to the system. "

Subject: [Oralux] Saving Braille Preferences
Date: Thu, 29 Jul 2004 06:31:12 -0700

Or rather, not succeeding at saving them.  [smile]  I found the TTY
preferences menu and set the Braille contraction table to US Grade 2.  I
wasn't sure if the "save on exit" menu item was relevant, but I specified
"yes"

I ran the saveconfig script and said "yes' to all.  Everything is being
saved on a zip disk, and I've successfully saved my other preferences.  Am I
missing something?

Just for the record, I have to say that I very much appreciate the Braille
options in the startup menu.  That has helped quite a lot.

---------------------


+ VM configuration (name, mail address, host parameters)
Note:
(setq vm-folder-directory "~/mail/")
(setq vm-primary-inbox "free")
one name per mailbox ?

+ see gnus configuration

/ Internet: Eagle driver (Sagem fast 800)
/ Internet: 56K External modem

+ At the end of the menu, asks if the preferences must be saved (except for hdinstal...).
+ When a new release is available, ask if the .emacs, .vm,... files must be removed.
+ Clearly say that RETURN must be pressed once the CD is ejected.
+ New messages without translation.
+ dialog: --extra-label --extra-button (return 3) --cancel-label (1) --ok-label (0)  --help-button --help-label (2)

+ D'ou vient le .bashrc obsolete sous /root ?

+ After this message, DECtalk hangs: "MML Voice Abrev Fill Charac auto-saving done" (From Nath).

Message from Edmond.
--------------------------------------
+ Add nano
+ dot emacs saved in the persistent home, unfortunately saveconfig was not called again. 
Then the old one .emacs is retreived at the next boot.

"Une petite remarque qui m'a coûté bien du temps et que peut-être tu pourras répercuté sur lal liste mieux que moi.
J'avais modifié le fichier .emacs soigneusement comme tu l'as indiqué dans un message mais quelle ne fut pas ma surprise de voir que malgré la modification, rien ne partait. Je te rappelle ma config : démarrage sur le cd, une partition créée avec mkpersistenthome et une disquette sur laquelle je sauvegardais les paramètres. "
+ Add bbdb (see .emacs + .vm)

Feedback from Nigel
--------------------------------------
/ C-a doesn't speak the line: rather an emacspeak feature.
- Dired mode: no audio feedback
- kill buffer: the next current buffer is not announced. 
* Pb using the uk keyboard
* End of file missing at DECtalk installation ?

Feedback from IBP
--------------------------------------
+ Multispeech and Emacspeak 20.0
--------------------------------------
1) It is something wrong with the pre-generated letters. All letters
   are spoken by one voice though the voice must depend on register
   and some letters are spoken wrongly, for example, the letter "o" is
   spoken as "r".

2) The English pronunciation dictionary
   /usr/local/share/mbrola/lexicon.en is wrong or is not used.

3) There are some problems in the Emacs russification.

4) The Russian pronunciation dictionary Rulex is not used outside
   Emacspeak.

5) All items in the dired mode are spoken by one voice. This problem
   had appeared in new versions of Emacspeak. In the old versions (up
   to 17 anyway) the files, symlinks and directories were spoken by
   different voices.


Feedback from Sergei
--------------------------------------

The actual code that
causes problem with Russian stuff is under "keyboard" section. This
part might be either removed if the Russian language is selected or
put somewhere before loading Russian stuff. There are some tips to
help you testing whether it is OK or not. 

1. In the startup menu select all Russian settings "including
   keyboard". 
2. After Emacspeak is loaded, open a new buffer.
3. Switch your keyboard to Russian. It is done by pressing the right
   ctrl key (very inconvenient, another reason for me not to use the
   default driver).
4. Try typing some symbols. If evrything is correct, you then should
   hear the Russian voice echoing what you type. Otherwise you will
   hear English voice echoing punctuation marks, octal codes etc. 
5. Switch the keyboard back to English (withh the same right ctrl key)
   and now try to switch keyboard within Emacs itself by pressing
   Ctrl+backslash keys. If all settings are correct, you will hear the
   Russian letters. If not, there will still be English.

I hope that it will help you better debug the Russian settings.

Another issue i have noticed is a behaviour of the English voice. It
speaks with strange accent. I suspect, that somewhere perhaps by
mistake a French pronounciation dictionry is loaded for mbrola?

--------------------------------------
+ package console-cyrillic
+ Yasr: bsdgames includes a very good "adventure" game wich can be played from the command line.

--------------------------------------

Feedback from Barak
--------------------------------------
1. First time no sound - solved by cheatcode 
knoppix alsa
Cheatcode not needed after preferences are saved.

/ 2. Long wait time caused by Oralux searching for config file on non-existing 
floppy - no longer happens after saveconfig to hard-drive.

3. Missing ADSL (ALE070) support.
This is a "chicken and egg" problem, must first have the tar gz package
on a partition that is readable by Oralux before booting Oralux.
Extracted eciadsl-usermode-0.8 (latest is 0.9 on eciadsl.flashtux.org) to 
a persistent home directory. 
configured and installed using:

(as root)
$ ./configure --prefix=/home/knoppix/eciadsl_install --conf-prefix=/home/knoppix/eciadsl_install --conf-dir=/etc --etc-prefix=/home/knoppix/eciadsl_install
$ make
$ make install
and later running ~knoppix/eciadsl_install/bin/eciconftxt.sh 
accepting default suggestion for all questions without going too much into
what these mean (just chose yes when unsure, seems quite far from knoppix 
autodetect).
Expected pitfalls:
VPI/VCI are 8,48 as I remember from windows connection.
User is username@IBezint and not just username.

startmodem can be launched after copying additional files (required by pppd)
cp -rf ~knoppix/eciadsl_install/etc/* /etc
~knoppix/eciadsl_install/bin/startmodem
(sometimes fails synchronizations, most of the time successful connect).

4. the dot emacs file is overwritten by the original dot emacs file 
after next oralux reboot (I needed to remodify user-mail-address 
and user-full name again).

5. Sending and Receiving Mail
Once connected, M-x mail works fine, but trying to receive mail fails.
fetchmail appears to be too much work to configure.

So I utilized my fresh .gnus file (gathered from the *info* pages).
Normally M-x gnus causes .gnus to be evaluated, but with emacspeak it
should be evaluated explicitly (or better add it to .emacs file)

(setq gnus-secondary-select-methods
      '((nnml "private")))

(setq mail-sources
      '(
;;(file :path "/var/spool/mail/username")
	(pop :server "mail.server"
	     :user "username"
	     :port "pop3"
	     :password "secret"
)))
--------------------------------------
Games:
Since Yasr have become a part of the Oralux distribution, i would
suggest to include "bsd-games" package, which contains, among other
tools a very good "adventure" game wich can be played from the command
line.
--------------------------------------

Feedback from Nigel
--------------------------------------
Just want to clarify a few things.  Reading the title of the buffer reads
out all the buffers that are open.
When using F10 and then the F key there is a cariter at the end that sounds
like control 3 although it is only one character.
dot dot does not seem to be pronounced to well as in save as..
I tried to create a new buffer and typed something in it, but I must have
done some thing wrong when I tried to load ispell, got a bit lost and had a
devil of a time trying to close down cd tool.
Not sure if this is why i was having trouble closing the *scratch* buffer,
which latterer turned into *compleate*.  This was dispite me hitting c-x k
and then return.
using the su command to switch to root works fine.  pressing return after
the cd has ejected shut down the machine fine.

+ speak the C-x,... pressed keys

+ Today, in French, punctuation is said in English.

+ use caps-lock as the control key, see a solution whichever the current keymap (fr, qwerty,...).
Original message from Barak:
We might want to add Robert J. Chassel's suggestion from the
Emacspeak new user guide to the introduction menu/this text . For
example: add an option to use caps-lock as the control key by running:
loadkeys /usr/share/keymaps/i386/qwerty/emacs2.kmap.gz 
Note that running this command from an emacs shell fails, but running it from the other terminals (type Alt F2 to get there, type Alt F1 to get back here) works.

1.2 Priority 2

+ Nath: clipboard (particularly for links2)
+ General default auditory icons player whichever the voice synthesis. At the moment, most of our proposed voice synthesizers, do not manage the auditory icons.
  
+ From Terrence:
Also, I've made my persistent home directory so big that it's crowded my c:/hda1 hard drive.  Is there a way to remake the directory so it's not so huge?

+ By default, the return key means yes and any other key means no. 
Yes, once the keyboard has been selected, this expectation (return key instead of S in spanish) can be misleading. 
The menu could be updated so that the localized yes/no key are accepted. 

+ German synthethis based on Festival+MBROLA:
For information, Thomas in his mail informed us about a German software synthesis based on Festival and MBROLA; it is available at this URL:
http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/phonetik/synthesis/
He asked if it would be possible to include in Oralux. 
However, I do not know who at the moment, could work on it. 

+ Seebytouch: as soon as the GUI is available, we will include the Seebytouch project (http://see-by-touch.sourceforge.net/index_.html).
+ take in account the new emacs intro from Nigel (en/draft)
+ Repeat keys : delay and rate.
+ command key echo in emacspeak
+ ebooks: talk with Doug.
+ Spec TechniBraille for Braille display (after 0.6).
+ Building menu using MBROLA for languages not supported by DECtalk (Dutch,...).
+ If the user types C-z, Alt F2,..., a clear report must inform him. 
+ (C-e d c) Using Flite or EFM, the capital letters are not preceded by a specific sound (as it is with DECtalk).
+ C-e d r 180 doesn't work using EFM (but C-e d 1 works).
+ License of RealPlayer?

package: shorewall (Shoreline Firewall), gshield
Webmin: accessible ?

+ Spanish Translation: mkpersistenthome: MESSAGE_NO_PARTS en espagnol "No suitable partitions could be found. Remember that NTFS-Partitions are not writable with linux."
+ Spanish and German translation: "to accept it" replace "to quit"
  {"Press Enter to increase volume, or Space to decrease volume, or any other key to accept it",
   "Eingabetaste drücken um die Lautstärke zu erhöhen oder Leertaste drücken um die Lautstärke zu verringern oder jede andere Taste zum beenden",

Est-il possible lorsque le bureau choisi est emacspeak et la synthèse
parlemax, d'ouvrir une autre console et de lancer sur celle-ci parlemax ? Si
EFM est sélectionné, aucun problème pour avoir deux consoles sonorisées.
---
From Laurent

Great, it works, -- well sort of.

Under flight, no problem switching between an emacspeak session on tty1 and loading Yasr.  However, I had to fiddle around to make it "work" using dectalk.

Starting off with the Dectalk synth and Emacspeak, it appears that despite being loaded on virtual consoles (remember, I don't fully know the implications) Dectalk and Flight have a fight concerning use of the soundcard.  Well, that is only my deduction.  Simply typing "yasr" on tty2 starts it with Flight.

To "disengage the soundcard from dectalk", I have to press c-e s in Emacspeak to enable flight to speak under tty2.  For myself, its not a big problem, since I've actually come to like flight, finding it quite responsive.

The issue of the yasr keymaps is a problem, with e.g. the crucial review key not working.  The reverse i-search, e.g., still works, but I'm not sure whether its a bash or Yasr function.  Still have lots of reading to do.

So my main question is:  Firstly, how to envoke Yasr with Dectalk from the command line and
---

From Laurent: multi channel sound card
---
Under Windows, my soundcard can handle various outputs, e.g. a speech synth talking while playing music.  This does not work, to my knowledge, under Oralux and means that to use audio programmes effectively, I would have to use an external synthesizer.  It is then also probably the reason for the phenomenon between Dectalk and Flight mentioned in my previous post.

Is it a driver issue, or an issue with my card?  Is there a way to resolve this problem?  I have tried the alsa drivers, but it makes no difference.
---

+ Including Yasr. When the user quit Emacspeak, could we be under
Yasr?

+ Easy mounts
+ Console switching and aural feedback
- Initial Logo issue ? See Georges' answer
http://oralux.org/archives-ml.php?A=READ&L=ml_oralux.org/2003/7/15/0
+ Resizing a huge NTFS partition.

+ Consistent solution braille/voice

+ It the sound card detection fails, the oralux script must not be
started. The shell must be usable.

+ Check calendar and todo mode. 
+ Test babel.el 

+ Check the size of the ramdisk when the external tts is installed
+ Check the size of the user's partition
+ See how a root term may be used with Emacspeak without supplying any password 
+ HOWTO English/French (reachable from Emacspeak).


+ Suggestions from Mario Fux and Alireza Darvishy

1. The arrow keys left and right should work to read a word.
2. Shift+arrow keys should read the letters.
3. When you finish and restart Emacspeak there should be an acoustic signal
(btw: What about the a possible login with password. Did you find a solution
?)
4. It should be easier to stop the sound server, for example with double CTRL
?
5. The sound server shouldn't read the deleted letters.
/ 6. The menu thing (F10 and so on) is bad. When you press F10 it reads
something like "f equal equal greater than File" etc. and when you chose File
it reads again "o equal equal greater than Open File ( C dash x f )". It
would be easier when it only read (after pressing F10): "File   Edit  
Options" and in the menu File: "Open File   Open Directory".

+ Suggestions from Nigel for Emacs and YASR.

Pressing the Home key will move to the beginning of a line.
Pressing control Home will move to the beginning of the buffer.

Pressing the End key will move to the end of the line.
Pressing control End will move to the end of the buffer.

Pressing Page Up will move up a paragraph.
Pressing Page Down will move down a paragraph.


1.3 Priority 3
+ Oralux 1.x: clearer messages. E.g. the Emacs question once C-x k is pressed: "Kill buffer" is a question but can be understood as a confirmation. "Which buffer must be killed" would be better.
+ Check that installed binaries are i386 compliant
+ OCR
+ Test most of the Emacspeak applications
  http://Emacspeak.sourceforge.net/applications.html 
+ Installing the French TTS whereas DECtalk was already installed.
+ Loud speaker

1.4 Priority 4
+ A solution to store the user configuration on a NTFS filesystem.
+ Adding the oralux user
+ Automatic Speech recognition

2. SDK
2.1 Priority 1 (Urgent)
+ An easy process to customize the Oralux CD

2.2 Priority 2
+ After a new install on hd, fastly getting the usual environment (internet,...)

3. Website
3.1 Priority 1 (Urgent)
+ A visitor can't access the site (emacs 20.7 with w3-4.0-pre46). Not because of the web pages. Due to the server configuration?
/ Updating the FAQ, with the sent answers.
+ Adding a link about the hardware knoppix database 
http://knoppixfr.tuxfamily.org/index.php?page=hardware

3.2 Priority 2
+ Adding an entry 'Forum'
