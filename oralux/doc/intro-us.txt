2. How Oralux Talks.

Besides the synthesizer, two programs work together to make Oralux talk. One is
called Emacs, and the other, Emacspeak. Emacs is a text file editor with many
enhancements which make it a very powerful tool for doing virtually everything
on the computer. Emacspeak is a set of extensions which make the whole thing,
or the vast majority of it, talk. This means that to make this system work you
will eventually learn to use both emacs and emacspeak.

When Emacspeak is run, the first thing it does is to start Emacs. Then item
starts the speech extensions. So you can run emacs for silent operation or
Emacspeak for speech use.

3. Getting  Started.

The tutorials "My first steps in GNU/Emacs" and "The Calendar and the Diary" by Sylvie Xhaard are under the directory :
tutorials/en

A good place to start with Emacs is the Emacs tutorial. 
You can do this now by pressing Control+h, t. That is, hold down the
Control key and press h, then release them both and press t.

If you are new to Emacspeak, you may want to read the Emacspeak Info pages:
Control+h, i, m Emacspeak.
Since Emacspeak is running now, you can get to its FAQ by pressing Control+e, Shift+f.

A list of Emacspeak key bindings is in the Emacs help system; use Control+h,
Control+e.
