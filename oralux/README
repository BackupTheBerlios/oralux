2. Installing the Oralux tree
2.1 Knoppix on hd
2.2 Installing the Oralux sdk
3. mkmyknoppix


1. Introduction
1.1 Required Hardware
The first step is to check that you have the necessary amount of free
space on your hard disk.
Today, you need around 9.5 Gb shared in 3 partitions: 
- one big partition (6 GB) where Knoppix is installed. 
- one for building and testing the CD (2.5 GB)
- and another one for the swap (the size of the RAM + the swap must equal 1GB). 

1.2 Required Files
The following files will be downloaded and stored in $HOME/oralux/install/arch

Softwares:
http://switch.dl.sourceforge.net/sourceforge/emacspeak/emacspeak-20.tar.bz2
http://fr.rpmfind.net/linux/blinux/emacspeak/blinux/emacspeak-ss-1.9.1.tar.gz
http://www.pollock-nageoire.net/patches/efm-install-util.tgz

multispeech (for future use)
ftp://ftp.rakurs.spb.ru/pub/Goga 
under projects/speech-interface/multispeech-1.2.2.tar.bz2
and slackware-packages/8.1/speach-interface/multispeech-1.2-i586-1.tgz 
http://leb.net/pub/blinux/mbrola/blinux/RPMS/mbrola-tts-English-a9m_d-3.i386.rpm
http://atrey.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/~clock/twibright/links/download/links-2.1pre15.tar.gz

rawrite.exe comes from:
http://download.fedora.redhat.com/pub/fedora/linux/core/1/i386/os/dosutils/rawrite.exe

If you already have the KNOPPIX iso file (e.g. for Oralux 0.06: KNOPPIX_V3.3-2004-02-16-EN.iso), 
renames it $HOME/oralux/factory/iso/knoppixCD.iso

2. Installing the Oralux tree

2.1 Knoppix on hd
First install KNOPPIX on your hard disk in a single partition. Please, avoid an old KNOPPIX release on hd: you could met incompatibilities in regards e.g. of the cloop versions.

I used knoppix-installer.

2.2 Installing the Oralux sdk
Uncompressed the Oralux tarball:

cd $HOME

tar -zxvf Oralux-dev_0.6.tar.gz

And under root: 
ln -s /home/MyAccount/oralux /root

To build the Oralux tree under root.

[Note April 2004: CVS will be available after July 2004]. 
If you choose to check out the files from the CVS, please choose the tagged files (e.g. o006). 
The surer way is to download the tarball from the oralux.org website.

Edit the configuration file named install/oralux.conf and update it according your cdrom features and your partition. 

3. mkmyknoppix

Internet is required to update and add the debian packages or the tarballs.
Run as root:
apt-get update

cd /root/oralux/install
./mkmyknoppix

There are several stages. Typing return, jumps a stage; pressing the y key, and then return, starts the stage.
Be very careful with any of this stage. More details follow.

3.1 Clear the $HOME/oralux/factory/newOralux directory and temporary files ?
I answered yes (y).

3.2 Make a KNOPPIX CD ISO image from the KNOPPIX CDROM?
No, because my KNOPPIX iso was already renamed as $HOME/oralux/factory/iso/knoppixCD.iso

3.3 Extract and Make the ISO from the KNOPPIX CD ISO image?
Yes

3.4 Remove /home/gilles/oralux/factory/iso/extractedKnoppix.iso?
No

3.5 Remove unused packages?
Yes. This stage is not quite clean today. If this exits, you may want to start again the script, and jump to the next stage...

3.6 Add softwares?
Yes

Then, there will be distinct sub stages:
general.sh, tcl.sh,...
The installation of efm takes a long time but is automatic.
We have added a few details which are not yet automatically isntalled (see please install/efm).

3.7 Updating indexes?
Yes.

3.8 Creating ISO image for new KNOPPIX? (around half an hour to one hour)
Yes!

3.9 Burning CD
The following stages help to burn the CD.
Besides it, you may want to boot on the partition where Oralux is built ($HOME/oralux/factory/build) and 

* Scan bus about your CD recorder?
This is a reminder. The returned number might be equal to this one in your $HOME/oralux/install/oralux.conf file.

* Erase CD?
* Burn CD?
