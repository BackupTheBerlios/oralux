Notes about using the prepared boot floppy for booting Oralux.
=======

To boot a computer from the Oralux CD, you must insert the prepared boot
floppy into floppy drive, the Oralux CD - into CDROM drive and restart
your computer.
If you don't hear, that the computer is reading the CD, after a long
time (more than 30 seconds), since the floppy was read, try to restart
your computer again.


Users, which have more than one CDROM drive, must insert the Oralux CD
into that drive, which is the first connected on IDE bus. If you don't
understand what it is all about, try to investigate which drive is
needed by trying each drive in order.
