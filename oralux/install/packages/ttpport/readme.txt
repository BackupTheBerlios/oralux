Original readme.txt from port_tts:
http://tcts.fpms.ac.be/synthesis/mbrola/tts/Portuguese/port_tts.zip

Usage:
echo "ele age muito de acordo com o normal" | ./ttp_p.pl

or 

cat teste.txt | ./ttp_p.pl

this produces sound directly through mbrola. needs also a utility that can accept raw audio on its standard input.

this a basic perl tts to portuguese based on the spanish one. 
Was made as a work for a discipline in Minho University.

If you are using this we will be glad to hear from you.
