Here is a very alpha release of the oralux installer:
* based on knoppix-installer (no change) from KNOPPIX 3.3 (2004 02 16)
* dialog has been rewritten (no graphical layout). 
In most cases, you will just have to select an option in a numbered list: type the wished number and then press return.
 
* fdisk is used instead of cfdisk

Warning:
1. Knoppix-installer offers 2 kinds of installation: the Knoppix or Debian-like installation.
Only the knoppix option has been tested.

2. You will supply information to add a user and set the root password. These informations will be lost.
Once Oralux will be installed on hard disk, there will be the usual knoppix user (no password required) and to become root a simple su will be enough (still no password required).
